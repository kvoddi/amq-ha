Hello Kalyan,

Setting up and running Cadence workflows involves several steps, which I will outline in a detailed and structured manner for your understanding as a platform engineer:

### Initial Setup

1. **Install Cadence Server:**
   - Use a pre-built Docker image or compile from source.
   - Ensure you have a supported database (like Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and messaging system (like Kafka).

2. **Configure Cadence Cluster:**
   - Set up the database schema.
   - Configure the service front end, matching service, history service, and worker service.

3. **Monitoring and Metrics:**
   - Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus.
   - Set up dashboards for real-time monitoring of Cadence metrics.

### Workflow Design

1. **Workflow Definition:**
   - Define workflows in a programming language supported by Cadence (like Go or Java).
   - Use the Cadence SDK to interact with the Cadence server.

2. **Activity Design:**
   - Design activities as idempotent operations.
   - Include timeout and retry policies.

3. **Workflow Configuration:**
   - Configure execution parameters like task list, execution start-to-close timeout, and task start-to-close timeout.

4. **Testing:**
   - Implement unit tests for workflows and activities.
   - Use the Cadence test framework for mocking and assertions.

### Deployment

1. **Deploying Workers:**
   - Deploy workers that host the workflow and activity implementations.
   - Ensure workers are scalable and resilient.

2. **Versioning and Upgrades:**
   - Implement versioning strategies for workflows.
   - Handle schema changes and backward compatibility.

3. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
   - Ensure smooth rollouts with minimal downtime.

### Execution and Monitoring

1. **Starting Workflows:**
   - Use the Cadence client to start workflows.
   - Handle workflow IDs and run IDs properly.

2. **Monitoring Executions:**
   - Monitor active workflows and activities through Cadence Web UI or CLI.
   - Set up alerts for failures or delays.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling and compensation logic in workflows.
   - Use retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers as needed.

4. **Logging and Tracing:**
   - Integrate logging frameworks.
   - Implement distributed tracing for better insight into workflow executions.

### Scaling and Optimization

1. **Scaling Strategies:**
   - Scale workers based on workload.
   - Optimize task lists for efficient task distribution.

2. **Performance Tuning:**
   - Tune workflow and activity configurations for optimal performance.
   - Profile and optimize resource usage.

3. **High Availability:**
