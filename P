}

// Activity options with retry policy
activityOptions := activity.RetryPolicy{
	InitialInterval:    time.Second,
	BackoffCoefficient: 2.0,
	MaximumInterval:    time.Minute,
	MaximumAttempts:    5,
}
```

### 3. Workflow with Timeouts

A workflow with an activity execution timeout:

```go
func TimeoutWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
	ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{
		StartToCloseTimeout: time.Minute, // Timeout for the activity
	}
	ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)

	err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SampleActivity).Get(ctx, nil)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}
```

### 4. Sending and Handling Signals in Workflow

Workflow receiving a signal:

```go
func SignalWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
	var signalVal string
	signalChan := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, "sampleSignal")
