In my role as a computer engineer at a large bank, I successfully contributed to two key projects:

Contribution 1: Externalizing Transaction Logs in IBM WebSphere

    I extended the logging framework within WebSphere applications, enabling externalization of transaction logs.
    Custom log handlers were developed to redirect logs to external systems, improving accessibility and analysis.
    Logs were standardized for consistency, easing cross-platform interpretation.
    Integration with monitoring tools allowed real-time application performance insights.
    Mechanisms for rapid error identification were implemented.
    Comprehensive documentation and training were provided for teams.

Contribution 2: Enabling Tracing on Kafka using Zipkin

    I integrated Zipkin with Kafka to enhance observability in our microservices.
    Instrumentation of Kafka producers and consumers generated trace data for message tracking.
    Trace context propagation was implemented for end-to-end trace continuity.
    Zipkin server setup and configuration enabled centralized trace data storage and visualization.
    Trace data was monitored and analyzed using Zipkin's web interface to identify bottlenecks, diagnose issues, and optimize message processing.
    Collaboration with development and operations teams ensured effective utilization of Zipkin for debugging and performance tuning.
