}

// Activity options with retry policy
activityOptions := activity.RetryPolicy{
	InitialInterval:    time.Second,
	BackoffCoefficient: 2.0,
	MaximumInterval:    time.Minute,
	MaximumAttempts:    5,
}
```

### 3. Workflow with Timeouts

A workflow with an activity execution timeout:

```go
func TimeoutWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
	ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{
		StartToCloseTimeout: time.Minute, // Timeout for the activity
	}
	ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)
