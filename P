* Introduction
As on organization, lot of time was being spent on production outage calls from bothsupport and development teams, the downtime and errors were having significant financial implications for the organization and were also respoibsle for poor client experience.I recognized the importance of observability as a key driver of system reliability and customer satisfaction and pushed to adopt OpenTelemetry stack which values logs/traces and metrics euqllay and also create a stndard framework bettween multiple technology stacks.

* Championing Observability with OpenTelemetry and Open-Source Tools
I initiated a project to champion the adoption of advanced observability practices within the bank's IT department. This initiative included transitioning from proprietary solutions like Splunk and AppDynamics to open-source tools and OpenTelemetry, which offers more flexibility and control and also helped with creating a single UI(Grafana) instead of jumping between multiple UIs during outages.

* Leadership and Communication skills
I formed a cross-functional team of IT professionals with diverse skills, including software developers, systems administrators, and data analysts. This team played a pivotal role in the successful implementation of open-source observability tools.
Through effective leadership and clear communication, I ensured that the team had a shared vision of the project's goals and their individual roles in achieving those goals.

* Breakthrough Thinking
I encouraged my team to think innovatively. We explored new approaches to observability that leveraged open-source technologies and OpenTelemetry.
We conducted in-depth research on open-source tools and methodologies, and I facilitated brainstorming sessions to generate innovative solutions tailored to our specific needs.

As part of the observability initiative, we recognized the importance of distributed tracing for understanding the flow of requests across microservices and identifying performance bottlenecks.
We integrated OpenTelemetry's tracing capabilities into our applications, enabling us to trace requests as they traversed through various components.
The use of trace IDs became instrumental in correlating data across different services, allowing us to follow a request's journey through the entire system.
This enhanced traceability played a critical role in identifying and resolving performance issues quickly.

* Respectfully Challenging Ideas
I fostered a culture of continuous improvement and encouraged team members to challenge existing norms which relied hevailiy on logs and evangalized the use of traces for better service visibility.
Healthy debates led to the refinement of our observability strategy, ensuring the best practices were incorporated into our open-source observability approach.

* Implementation and Results
We successfully implemented open-source observability tools, leveraging OpenTelemetry for application instrumentation, and incorporating open-source log analysis and metrics collection solutions.
This transition not only reduced licensing costs but also provided greater flexibility in customizing our observability stack to the bank's unique requirements.
We were able to improve the system avaialblity by reducing system downtime, the FCI(Railed client interactions) were down by 28 % and calls to call centers were down by 40 %.

* Conclusion
Through my leadership, innovative thinking, and the transition to open-source observability tools and OpenTelemetry, the project delivered tangible business results. This transition not only reduced costs but also improved observability, leading to significantly reduced downtime, customer complaints, MTTI(Mean Time for Identification) and MMTR(Mean Time for Resolution).
The success of this initiative highlights the value of open-source observability solutions, the use of tracing, and trace IDs in enhancing system reliability and customer satisfaction.
